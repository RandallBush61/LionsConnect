# LionsConnected

This is a repository for containing the project I assisted/worked on during my time at SELU called LionsConnected. My primary contribution here was on the front end UI as well as hitting band end API using http request (GET, PULL, etc).

The deisre goal of this project was for student to have their own personal logins', the ability to post journal entries, and with the potentail ability for students to be able to communicate to each other though the software.
